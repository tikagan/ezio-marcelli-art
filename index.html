              Ezio Marcelli was born on February 17, 1954 in Colle- ferro (Rome) Italy. He attended the Liceo Artistico of Frosinone followed by the Academy of Fine Arts until being awarded a diploma in Painting in 1977. He moved to Canada in 1981 settling in Edmonton where he lived for 20 years working as a furniture draftsman. In 2002 he moved to Toronto, where he still lives, continuing his work as a furniture draftsman until 2019. After 42 years he took up painting once more; completing two canvases, Never Forgotten and Sadness, that he had brought unfinished from Italy. This marked the start of his producing newly inspired paintings which continues to this day.
